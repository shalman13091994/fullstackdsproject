process involves in MLOPS:

1.Data versioning -DVC (or alternatives like LakeFS, DeltaLake)
2.Source control Monitoring -Git,Github, gitlab
3.Experiment tracking - MLFlow
4.Feature store - feast, Tecton
5.Model serving - MLflow, FastAPI, TorchServe, Seldon, KServe
6.Model registry - MLflow Model Registry, SageMaker, Azure ML
7.Model monitoring - Prometheus, Grafana, Evidently AI
8.CI/CD pipeline (workflow/scheduling) - GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, Airflow
9.containarisation - Docker
10.Container Orchestration & Monitoring - Kubernetes, Docker Compose, Prometheus + Grafana



Optional (but useful) Add-ons:
Infrastructure as Code ‚Äì Terraform, Pulumi

Secrets Management ‚Äì Vault, AWS Secrets Manager

Data Validation ‚Äì Great Expectations, Deequ

Model Explainability ‚Äì SHAP, LIME


üîÅ Complete MLOps Lifecycle
1. Data Versioning ‚Äì DVC (or alternatives like LakeFS, DeltaLake)
Tracks changes in datasets and links them to code versions.

Ensures reproducibility and consistency across environments.

2. Source Control ‚Äì Git, GitHub, GitLab
Tracks changes in code, pipelines, configs.

Enables collaboration via branches, PRs, commits.

3. Experiment Tracking ‚Äì MLflow, Weights & Biases, Neptune
Logs model parameters, metrics, artifacts, versions.

Helps compare and reproduce model results.

4. Feature Store ‚Äì Feast, Tecton
Centralized store for preprocessed features.

Ensures consistency between training and production.

5. Model Registry ‚Äì MLflow Model Registry, SageMaker, Azure ML
Version control for models.

Tracks model stages (Staging, Production, Archived).

Supports model promotion and rollback.

6. Model Serving ‚Äì MLflow, FastAPI, TorchServe, Seldon, KServe
Deploys trained models as APIs or microservices.

Handles input/output and scalability.

7. Model Monitoring ‚Äì Prometheus, Grafana, Evidently AI
Tracks model performance, drift, latency, errors.

Alerts if model degrades in production.

8. CI/CD Pipelines ‚Äì GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, Airflow
Automates model training, testing, and deployment workflows.

Integrates testing, linting, container builds, deployment triggers.

9. Containerization ‚Äì Docker
Packages model code + dependencies for consistent deployment.

Supports local, cloud, or Kubernetes environments.

10. Container Orchestration & Monitoring ‚Äì Kubernetes, Docker Compose, Prometheus + Grafana
Manages deployment, scaling, health-checks of containers.

Monitors resource usage, uptime, and logs.
