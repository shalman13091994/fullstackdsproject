# make sure same version of libraries especially scikit-learn should be there so change the local version according to that
# And retrain the model and save the model.pkl and preprocessor.pkl with that same version of the docker 
# due to version mismatch of saved model.pkl and preprocessor.pkl will cause issue in the docker 
# used this version scikit-learn==1.2.0 #local version should suits same as docker version
